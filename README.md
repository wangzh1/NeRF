## NeRF
### 3/3 Fri.
Try to implement ray tracing method in camera_model.
### 3/6 Mon.
Finish doing ray tracing by plotting a sphere.
### 3/7 Tue.
Though realistic 3D models are complex, we can break down a model into infinite number of triangles and do intersect to render a 2D image(triangle mesh). But it is not differentiable and hard to optimize.

So NeRF uses volumetric rendering which is easier to optimize. $i.e.,\ (r,g,b,\sigma)$
